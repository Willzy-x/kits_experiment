        This is the basic data loader for 3D networks. It uses preprocessed data as produced by my (Fabian) preprocessing.
        You can load the data with load_dataset(folder) where folder is the folder where the npz files are located. If there
        are only npz files present in that folder, the data loader will unpack them on the fly. This may take a while
        and increase CPU usage. Therefore, I advise you to call unpack_dataset(folder) first, which will unpack all npz
        to npy. Don't forget to call delete_npy(folder) after you are done with training?
        Why all the hassle? Well the decathlon dataset is huge. Using npy for everything will consume >1 TB and that is uncool
        given that I (Fabian) will have to store that permanently on /datasets and my local computer. With htis strategy all
        data is stored in a compressed format (factor 10 smaller) and only unpacked when needed.
        :param data: get this with load_dataset(folder, stage=0). Plug the return value in here and you are g2g (good to go)
        :param patch_size: what patch size will this data loader return? it is common practice to first load larger
        patches so that a central crop after data augmentation can be done to reduce border artifacts. If unsure, use
        get_patch_size() from data_augmentation.default_data_augmentation
        :param final_patch_size: what will the patch finally be cropped to (after data augmentation)? this is the patch
        size that goes into your network. We need this here because we will pad patients in here so that patches at the
        border of patients are sampled properly
        :param batch_size:
        :param num_batches: how many batches will the data loader produce before stopping? None=endless
        :param seed:
        :param stage: ignore this (Fabian only)
        :param random: Sample keys randomly; CAREFUL! non-random sampling requires batch_size=1, otherwise you will iterate batch_size times over the dataset
        :param oversample_foreground: half the batch will be forced to contain at least some foreground (equal prob for each of the foreground classes)
